##Entity Descriptions
* A (Start of The Journey): The beginning of the adventure where you makes the first choice. This is important because it's the start
* B (Decision Point): The choice of whether to take the mountain path or enter the forest. This is crucial for the cave path.
* C (Hidden Cave): After taking the path, you end up finding a cave. This is important to reach the other pathline. 
* D (Dark Forest): If you avoid the mountain path and go through the forest, there is another option. Going to D still leads you to E.
* E (Explore Cave): This determines whether you enter the cave or not, leaving you with two choices.
